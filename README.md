# Astro Fleet

[![CI](https://github.com/Indivar/astro-fleet/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Indivar/astro-fleet/actions/workflows/ci.yml) [![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/Indivar/astro-fleet)](https://github.com/Indivar/astro-fleet/releases) [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

One codebase, many sites. A multi-site Astro monorepo starter for agencies and multi-brand companies.

Astro Fleet gives you a production-ready monorepo with shared components, per-site design tokens, Turborepo build orchestration, and deployment to Cloudflare Pages, Vercel, or a self-hosted VPS. Create a new site in one command. Brand it with a design preset. Deploy it independently.

**Built for AI-driven development.** Astro Fleet's project structure, typed component props, and clear configuration patterns are optimized for AI coding assistants. Tested extensively with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code). Also works with Gemini CLI and other AI coding tools. [See the AI Workflow Guide →](docs/ai-workflow.md)

## Live Demos

Three fully-built sites — same monorepo, same shared components, three completely different looks and feels. Each demo is a separate site under `sites/` with its own navigation, content, and design preset.

| Preset | Demo | Use Case | Live |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Corporate** | [Meridian Advisory](sites/meridian-advisory.com) | Management consulting firm | [astro-fleet-meridian.pages.dev](https://astro-fleet-meridian.pages.dev) |
| **SaaS** | [Flux Analytics](sites/flux-analytics.com) | Developer-tool product site | [astro-fleet-flux.pages.dev](https://astro-fleet-flux.pages.dev) |
| **Warm** | [Olive & Vine](sites/olive-and-vine.com) | Neighbourhood restaurant | [astro-fleet-olive.pages.dev](https://astro-fleet-olive.pages.dev) |

Each demo composes the **same shared components** (`Header`, `Footer`, `ServiceCard`, `ContactForm`, `CTABlock`, `Breadcrumb`) — but the navigation, section structure, hero layouts, and typography are all unique to the brand. The presets aren't colour-swap reskins; they're complete site personalities.

## Built with Astro Fleet

Real sites running in production on the same codebase as the demos above:

- **[vairi.com](https://www.vairi.com)** — AI-enhanced software development and business automation consultancy (Auckland, NZ)
- **[claspt.app](https://www.claspt.app)** — Encrypted markdown notes and password vault, available on the Microsoft Store, macOS, and Linux
- **[stakteck.com](https://www.stakteck.com)** — IT staffing, contract hiring, and staff augmentation across India

_More coming soon._ If you ship a site with Astro Fleet, open a PR adding it here — we'd love to feature it.

## Quick Start

**The fastest way — scaffold a new fleet with the CLI:**

```bash
bunx create-astro-fleet         # or: npm create astro-fleet
cd my-astro-fleet
bun install
bun run dev
```

The CLI prompts for a target directory, first-site domain, and design preset. Use `--domain` / `--preset` flags to skip prompts.

**Or clone this repo directly:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/indivar/astro-fleet.git
cd astro-fleet
bun install
bun run dev          # → starter site at localhost:4321
```

Add more sites to an existing fleet:

```bash
bunx create-astro-fleet add yourdomain.com saas
# or the equivalent bash:
./scripts/new-site.sh yourdomain.com saas
bun install
```

## What's Included

- **22 shared components + 3 layouts** — Header, Footer, SEO Head, CTA blocks, cards, forms, testimonials, breadcrumbs, pricing tables, FAQ accordions, team grids, timelines, hero sliders, section dividers, comparison tables, and more. All accept content via typed props, all use CSS variables for theming.
- **Design token system** — 3 presets (Corporate, SaaS, Warm) with a TypeScript interface. Create custom presets or modify colors and fonts per site without touching component code.
- **Site scaffolder** — Either `bunx create-astro-fleet` (cross-platform, interactive prompts) or `./scripts/new-site.sh domain.com [preset]` (bash) creates a new site from the starter template with the correct config, styles, and build pipeline wired up.
- **CMS-ready** — Meridian demo ships with [Keystatic](https://keystatic.com) wired up for editable content. Admin at `/keystatic` in dev, content committed as markdown. See [Adding a CMS](docs/adding-a-cms.md) for the pattern and alternatives.
- **Infrastructure templates** — Optional Docker Compose + Traefik + Caddy setup for self-hosting on a VPS. Run `./scripts/setup-infra.sh` to generate configs for your domains.
- **Framework-agnostic** — All components are native `.astro` files (zero JS by default). Need interactivity? Add React, Vue, Svelte, Solid, or Preact to any site — Astro's [Islands Architecture](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/) hydrates only the interactive parts.
- **Self-hosted fonts** — Astro 6 Fonts API downloads Google Fonts at build time and serves them from your domain. No runtime requests to third-party servers, better privacy, optimized fallbacks.
- **AI-first workflow** — Designed to be developed with Claude Code, Gemini CLI, or any AI coding assistant. Sample prompts and patterns in the [AI Workflow Guide](docs/ai-workflow.md).
